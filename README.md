<!-- ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT -->
## About The Experiment

1. This experiment is aimed at enhancing the performance of data analysis by introducing a Quality of Service (QoS) method.
2. The QoS method utilizes dynamic control of network and storage resources based on the detected congestions.
3. It aims to improve overall data transfer efficiency and resource allocation in congested environments.
4. The experiment investigates how network congestion and storage bottlenecks impact data processing speed and accuracy.
5. The proposed method dynamically adjusts resources to maintain optimal performance during heavy network or storage load.

# Client and Server Setup

The documentation for the client and server is located in their respective directories, separately for each.
